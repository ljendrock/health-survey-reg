# Health Survey Regression Analysis

This project has been adapted from a final project for my Master's degree at Eastern University. 

The purpose of this project is to select a subset of variables from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data collected in 2021 by telephone survey. This system collects data on a state-by-state basis about residents to monitor health-related risk behaviors, health status, and use of preventive care services. This data is provided in a trimmed CSV file, and was not cleaned prior to use in this project.

Selected variables are cleaned, exploratory data analysis is performed, and correlations are examined. Finally, a response variable is selected (number of days of poor mental health) and multiple regression models are created in an attempt to predict a respondent's number of poor mental health days. Throughout the analysis, discussions of data cleaning, transformation and modeling decisions and reasoning are provided.

Comments are provided throughout the code chunks to indicate the purpose of lines of code. Discussions are kept separate to clarify and justify overarching decisions.

Variable names are maintained from the original dataset. While the meanings of variables names are explained in the discussions, the BRFSS Codebook is provided for further clarification if desired.
